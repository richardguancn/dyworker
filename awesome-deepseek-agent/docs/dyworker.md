# Integrate with DYWorker

DYWorker is a local AI work assistant for everyday office tasks. Pick a folder as your workspace, describe a goal in plain language, and the assistant breaks it down and carries it out step by step — reading documents, drafting files, generating Word/Excel output, and operating desktop apps, always asking for confirmation before risky actions. All data stays on your machine.

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/richardguancn/dyworker
- **Platforms:** macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows 10/11, and Linux desktops (including Kylin V10, ARM64)

#### 1. Install DYWorker

Download the latest installer for your platform from the [DYWorker Releases page](https://github.com/richardguancn/dyworker/releases):

- **macOS**: `.dmg` or `.zip`
- **Windows**: `setup.exe` (per-user install, no admin rights required)
- **Linux (ARM64 / Kylin V10)**: `.AppImage` or `.deb`

To run from source (requires Node.js 22+ and npm 10+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardguancn/dyworker.git
cd dyworker
npm ci
npm run dev:electron
```

#### 2. Configure the DeepSeek Provider

On first launch, pick an identity profile ("General" or "Government"), then open **Settings → Model** and configure a model connection:

- **API endpoint**: `https://api.deepseek.com`
- **Model name**: `deepseek-v4-flash`
- **API key**: get one from the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)

DYWorker ships with a built-in **DeepSeek V4 Flash** preset covering the full **1M-token context window**, and talks to DeepSeek through the Responses API. API keys are stored encrypted via the system secure storage — never written to disk in plaintext.

To use images with DeepSeek V4 Flash, fill in an OpenAI-compatible vision service (address, model name, and key) in the same settings page. DYWorker sends the image to the vision service to produce a description, then hands it to DeepSeek V4 Flash for analysis.

Other OpenAI-compatible providers (Qwen, Zhipu, or an in-house service) work the same way — just point the endpoint, model name, and key. Multiple model configurations can be saved and switched freely.

#### 3. Run and Assign Tasks

Start DYWorker, choose a workspace folder, and describe what you need — for example: *"Read this PDF and turn it into a one-page Word summary."* The assistant will plan the steps, execute them, and save real files into your workspace.

- Risky commands and changes to your desktop ask for confirmation first; all file, command, network, and tool activity is logged for audit.

- Long tasks keep running in the background: DYWorker supports scheduled wake-ups (1 minute to 12 hours) and resumes interrupted tasks automatically.
- DYWorker remembers stable preferences and project rules (five types of long-term memory), and repeated multi-step workflows can be saved as reusable templates.
- Optional chat channels let you send tasks and receive results from your phone via QQ official bots or WeChat ClawBot.
